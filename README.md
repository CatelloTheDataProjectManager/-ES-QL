# ES|QL and Big Data

This document highlights my expertise in using ES|QL (Elasticsearch SQL) to analyze and manipulate large-scale data, along with my experience in the Elasticsearch and Kibana ecosystem.

## Overview of My Skills

### 1. **Proficiency in ES|QL**
- Expertise in executing SQL queries on Elasticsearch indices, simplifying data analysis with familiar SQL syntax.
- Skilled in leveraging processing commands such as:
  - **`from`**: Retrieving documents from data streams or indices.
  - **`where`**: Filtering data based on specific conditions.
  - **`eval`**: Creating and manipulating calculated columns.
  - **`rename`**: Renaming fields for clarity and standardization.

### 2. **Advanced Data Transformation**
- Applying transformations like **`dissect`** and **`grok`** to extract complex information from strings.
- Utilizing aggregations such as **`stats...by`** to group and synthesize large datasets.
- Expertise with **`auto_bucket`** for generating dynamic histograms.

### 3. **Data Enrichment**
- Creating and managing enrichment policies to add metadata from external indices in real-time.
- Seamlessly integrating enrichments into query pipelines for efficient result enhancement.

### 4. **Data Ingestion and Structuring**
- Configuring mappings to structure data according to analytical needs.
- Ingesting large volumes of data using APIs like **_bulk** to optimize performance.

### 5. **Visualization and Exploration in Kibana**
- Proficient in using **Kibana Discover** for interactive data exploration and visualization.
- Saving and reusing ES|QL queries in Kibana to create custom dashboards.
- Building powerful visualizations by combining ES|QL with advanced Kibana features.

### 6. **Big Data Project Management**
- Integrating ES|QL into complex analytical pipelines to address Big Data use cases, such as log analysis, performance monitoring, and anomaly detection.
- Optimizing query and transformation performance to handle large-scale datasets efficiently.
